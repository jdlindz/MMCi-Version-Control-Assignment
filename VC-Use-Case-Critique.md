Lecture 5 Laboratory in Version Control

This will be a team project focused on using version control to cooperatively compose and edit a document. The document should be on the subject "Interesting use cases for version control". If you Google the topic, you should be a variety of cases in which people have used version control for interesting projects, not necessarily for developing software. What I'd like your team to do is find such a use case and discuss/critique it. We will use this class time as a lab for getting familiar with using Git and Github with me and Ben Neely in the room so you can ask questions.

Goals & Assignment

Each team should create a Project in Github
As described in van Strien, create a plain text document and place it under version control, even better if you use Markdown, i.e. create a "*.md" file (see here for Github-flavored markdown).
The document should have these sections:

Description of Use Case

Why is it a good use of version control (Git/Github)?

Where does it fall short in leveraging version control tools?

What would you do differently?

We suggest that each team create a Github "Organization" (see here) and have all the team members join it.

The organization should create a Project entitled "mmci-versioncontrol-assignment"
As the organization, should create an empty *.md document on Github using the 'create new file' button
Then all members should 'fork' to clone the repo into their personal Github repos

In performing each assignment some version control conditions have to be met:

Each member of a team must perform a 'commit'

Each member of a team must perform a 'pull request'

You must use a 'branch' for each section of the document

When you are ready to submit your assignment on 7 July 2018

Create a 'Production' branch which will represent the final version of the assignment

Add me as a collaborator on your Repo (unless you've made it open to the public, otherwise just send me a link to the repo)
